# molu ðŸ‘§

The mail provider in the Skedulr stack. It is currently built to work with Google Mail. But, by implementing the required communication APIs, more providers can be added into the `molu` group.

## Running It

1. Install the requirements by running

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Generate a web client o-auth client using the google cloud console.

3. Using the client_id and client_secret from previous step, go to the [OAuth Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground) and run through an oauth flow to get the access token and refresh token.

4. Create a credentials.json in the following format

   ```json
   {
     "client_id": "[CLIENT_ID]",
     "client_secret": "[CLIENT_SECRET]",
     "access_token": "[ACCESS TOKEN]",
     "refresh_token": "[REFRESH TOKEN]"
   }
   ```

   - todo check when refresh token expires

5. Run main.py
